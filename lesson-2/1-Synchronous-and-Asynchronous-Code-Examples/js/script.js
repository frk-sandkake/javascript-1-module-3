// What is a Synchronous System?
// In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another.
//
// Think of this as if you have just one hand to
// accomplish 10 tasks. So, you have to complete one task at a time.
//
// Take a look at the GIF 👇 – one thing is happening at a time her

//
// You'll see that until the first img is
// loaded completely, the second img doesn't start loading.
//
//     Well, JavaScript is by default
//     Synchronous [single threaded]. Think about it like this – one thread means one hand with which to do stuff.


//
// What is an Asynchronous System?
//     In this system, tasks are completed independently.
//
//     Here, imagine that for 10 tasks, you have 10 hands. So, each hand can do each task independently and at the same time.
//
//     Take a look at the GIF 👇 – you can see that each img loads at the same time.

// Again, all the images are loading at their own pace. None of them is waiting for any of the others.



// Synchronous system, three images are in the same lane. One can't overtake the other. The race is finished one by one. If img number 2 stops, the following img stops.

// Asynchronous system, the three images are in different lanes. They'll finish the race on their own pace. Nobody stops for anybody:



// Synchronous Code Example

console.log(" I ");

console.log(" eat ");

console.log(" Ice Cream ");


// Let's say it takes two seconds to eat
// some ice cream. Now, let's test out an asynchronous system.
// Write the below code in JavaScript.


console.log("I");

// This will be shown after 2 seconds

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("eat");
},2000);

console.log("Ice Cream");


// Now that you know the difference between synchronous and async operations,
